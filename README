The Bare C++ library
====================

The Bare C++ library is an (almost) standard C++-11 library
specially designed for working in the kernel ring (ring 0), for
example, with exokernel operating systems and similar
systems that lack classical memory protection.

The only supported systems at the moment are BareMetal
OS and Linux (the last one is used as a base for running
a test set).

The Bare C++ library is not based on any existing C++
library but designed from scratch. It's not even based
on the C library or POSIX and uses things directly. So, we
sacrifice the tradition for better support of new conceptions
like library-level address control for protect memory as
an alternative to SIGSEGV etc.

The library is freely distributed under the conditions of
the 3-clause BSD license.

For information of compiling the library and sample
applications see INSTALL.

Note by Beliriel after forking:
The original repository had a submodule in std/types which
in this repository got merged into the master branch and is
not externalised.  
In addition small changes have been made to the code, because
it didn't compile on Linux. I do not claim to really understand
the code, but I fixed all the compilation errors that happened
on Linux Ubuntu 18.04. The changes are documented in Changelog.md
