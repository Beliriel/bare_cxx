The Bare C++ library
====================

The Bare C++ library is (almost) standard C++-11 library
specially designed for working in the kernel ring, for
example, with exokernel operating systems and similar
systems that lack a classical memory protection.

Now the only supported systems are BareMetal
OS and Linux (the last one is used as a base for runnung
a test set).

The Bare C++ library is not based on any existing C++
library but designed from scratch. It ever not based on C
library or POSIX and uses things directly. So, we sacrify
the tradition for better support of new conceptions like
library-level address control for protect memory as an
alternative to SIGSEGV etc.

The library is freely distributed under the conditions of
the 3-clause BSD license.

For information of compiling the library and sample
applications see INSTALL.
